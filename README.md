I created this repository as a boilerplate for Express and MongoDB databases, which I can use for future projects. This repository includes the following features:

1. Login and Signin endpoints with JWT authentication
2. Error handling
3. Protection layer
4. API limitation
5. View engine using Pug
6. Addition of email verification functionality

Upcoming updates:

1. Enhancement of the basic MVC boilerplate
